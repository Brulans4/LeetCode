# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repository contains my personal solutions to **LeetCode** programming problems, all implemented in **Java**.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

- Strengthen proficiency in **data structures and algorithms**
- Enhance **analytical and problem-solving skills**
- Maintain a well-organized and maintainable reference of solved problems
- Present a professional portfolio for **technical interviews** and curriculum vitae (CV) review

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own dedicated directory following the naming convention below:

`_<problemNumber>_<ProblemNameInCamelCase>`

### Example Directories

_0001_TwoSum

_0206_ReverseLinkedList


## Directory Contents

Each problem directory typically contains:

- A Java source file defining a `Solution` class
- A complete and optimized algorithmic implementation
- A `main` method for local testing and verification

## Intended Use

This repository is intended to serve as:

- A personal **learning journal** documenting progress on LeetCode
- A **revision resource** for software engineering interviews
- A **public technical portfolio** demonstrating Java programming and algorithmic competence

## Disclaimer

All solutions reflect my personal understanding and approach at the time of implementation.  
Alternative solutions may exist with different performance characteristics or design trade-offs.
